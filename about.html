        <h3>website Developer</h3>
        <p>I am a skilled IT professional with a diverse background in technology, development, and design. My
            expertise spans multiple domains, allowing me to tackle challenges and deliver innovative solutions
            effectively.

            In IT support, I excel at troubleshooting hardware and software issues, system maintenance, and
            providing reliable user support to ensure seamless operations. My mobile app development experience
            includes creating Android applications with Java and Android Studio, integrating Firebase for robust
            backend functionality.

            I am proficient in web development, building dynamic and responsive web applications using HTML5, CSS3,
            JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. My knowledge of networking includes configuring IP
            addressing, routing protocols like RIP and OSPF, VLANs, VPNs, DNS, and DHCP, ensuring optimized and
            secure networks.

            On the creative side, I specialize in graphic design, utilizing Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and
            InDesign to craft compelling UI/UX designs, branding, and visual communication. I am also experienced in
            video editing, producing high-quality content with Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and motion
            graphics tools.

            I am well-versed in tools and technologies like Git, Wireshark, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and
            Packet Tracer, which enhance my productivity and problem-solving capabilities. Complementing my
            technical skills, I possess strong soft skills in communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and
            time management, enabling me to work effectively in teams and deliver results on time.

            I am passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions. Whether it's building
            software, optimizing a network, or crafting engaging visuals, I approach every project with dedication,
            creativity, and a commitment to excellence. I thrive in dynamic environments and look forward to
            contributing my skills to meaningful projects.
